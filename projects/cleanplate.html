        <p>Cleanplate was a not-for-profit helping food-based creators communicate their climate impact. Sharing a common interest in food sustainability, as well as an enthusiasm for a technologically driven solution, I joined with two friends to develop Cleanplate.</p>
        
        <p>Cleanplate sought to promote the carbon labelling of food items, in the belief that better informed consumers can make more sustainable dietary choices. Our goal was to enable food influencers to share the carbon impact of the food they promote, bridging the gap between culinary content and environmental awareness.</p>

        <p>In this role I was responsible for building our mobile app, which is available on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/tj/app/cleanplate/id1573742155?platform=iphone" target="_blank">app store</a>. This app was built with Flutter, allowing us to target both iOS and Android audiences, and required an iterative engineering process in order to achieve production level quality.</p>

        <p>We decided to shut down this project as we were all too busy to give Cleanplate the time it needed. Despite the project ending, the experience provided valuable insights into mobile development, sustainability tech, and the challenges of scaling a social impact startup.</p>
