          <h2>Data Scientist<br />ElectronRx<br />2019 - 21</h2>
          <p>Previously working as a data scientist at a Cambridge based biotech start-up. This role entailed building a predictive algorithm to infer blood pressure from a ppg (photoplethysmography) signal, taken by a smartphone camera. This involved harnessing approaches proposed in recent literature to develop a sufficiently accurate machine learning model and effective signal processing pipeline. The work was then integrated with the wider app platform, which aims to allow any modern smartphone to become a medical grade device. I was also been responsible for developing and maintaining the more foundational algorithms that make up FoneDx, the cloud-based service. FoneDx supports the calculation of heart rate and respiratory rate from ppg signals, as well as additional metrics of interest to clinicians.</p>

          <h2>Data Science Intern<br />Featurespace<br />2019</h2>
          <p>Over a two-month period I worked to produce an account application fraud detection model. The model was trained to score applications as either fraudulent orsafe. The model had many components, including features generated from user sequence analysis, computed using Markov chains, an entity resolution component and more general network analysis components. The features were then passed to an XGBoost classifier which achieved an AUC of over 0.9.</p>

          <h2>Technical Lead<br />CleanPlate<br />2021 - Present</h2>
          <p>In my spare time I have been working with friends on a non-profit campaigning for carbon labelling on food packaging. To push for this goal we have two parallel strategies, the first is to campaign via social media and raise awareness for the position. The second strategy, which I am focused on, is to develop an app which allows users to calculate the CO2kgeq of a certain recipe. The app is now available on the app store and we are working to test and further develop the app.</p>
