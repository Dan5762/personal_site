          <p>This paper sets out an architecture that appears to be both scalable to brain scale neuron counts and connectivity. To achieve these scales they use a combination of superconducting loops and optical interconnects, which can mirror the behaviour of collections of human neurons. The proposal still faces many challenges in scaling in areas such as photon loss, however on paper and early results their approach seems plausible. The idea of a human scale and beyond brain, processing 4-5 orders of magnitude faster at equivalent energy costs is truly sci-fi.</p>

          <h2><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08535" target="_blank">Why I am optimistic about the silicon-photonic route to quantum computing</a> - <a href="https://www.qisforquantum.org/about-the-author" target="_blank">Terry Rudolph</a></h2>
          <p>I've found a lot of Terry Rudolph's papers enjoyable to read, with touches of humour often mixed in. In this paper he is especially light hearted, making a case for the photonic measurement based approach to quantum computing. This was one of my favorite introductions to this approach and definitely convinced me.</p>

          <h2><a href="https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30509-3" target="_blank">Neuroscience-Inspired Artificial Intelligence</a> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demis_Hassabis" target="_blank">Demis Hassabis</a></h2>
          <p>With the current rate of progress in AI it can be easy to forget the root of a lot of the ideas. In this paper the authors give a detailed history of the co-evolution of the two fields. The paper makes a good case for continued cross-pollination, not just for the sake of advancing AI but also because it may "yield insights into some of the deepest and the most enduring mysteries of the mind".</p>

          <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindsight_(Watts_novel)" target="_blank">Blindsight</a> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Watts_(author)" target="_blank">Peter Watts</a></h2>
          <p>Hard sci-fi might sound pretty nerdy, and maybe it is, however this book is my favourite first contact novel. If your skepticism can get past the blurb you'll appreciate the depth of the authors thoughts. It's hard to imagine an alien life truly unrecognisable to anything on earth, but Peter Watts does a great job taking the reader on this journey.</p>

          <h2><a href="http://localroger.com/prime-intellect/" target="_blank">The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect</a> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Metamorphosis_of_Prime_Intellect" target="_blank">Roger Williams</a></h2>
          <p>A big name for a small book. That said the ideas inside are pretty profound, provided you can get past the seemingly crude and graphic BDSM heavy first half (it'll make sense if you get past that!). Some may roll their eyes too at the quantum quirks the book contrives, however I'm of the opinion that all bets are off once you introduce an intelligence orders of magnitude greater than ours.</p>

          <p>Following the sci-fi theme, Ted Chiang's short stories are great. Unlike the previous settings, these stories are more timeless. The first story retells the story of the tower of Babylon with an interesting layer added at the end. My favourite in this collection is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understand_(story)" target="_blank">Understand</a>, it gets pretty ridiculous by the end, but in the best possible way.</p>

          <p>Just to prove I don't only read sci-fi, here's a great book set thousands of years before any talk of singularities and alien contact. I found this book a real page turner and a great lesson on the ins and outs of Roman politics and life.</p>
